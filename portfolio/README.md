### The Future of This Branch
I've decided not to continue working on this branch. Originally, I created this branch to better understand React in the hopes
that eventually I'd replace the Nextjs in the main branch. I've realised this was a mistake due to their differing usecases 
which led me to my decision. This will remain unfinished, however it is a good place to see a working React + Webpack example
so I won't delete this.
